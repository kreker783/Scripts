Hello,

This is simple script to print content of utmp file.

How to use script:

1. Script was created only for Linux systems.
2. You need to have Python 3.6 or higher for script work properly. It's because of f-String format, you can always change it.
3. To run script type "python3 name_of_your_file.py". 
4. Optional: you can provide a specific username after you run the script, so it will print records only relevant to this user.

Enjoy :)
