# Port Check

This Python script is used to check whether a specified port is open on a given IP address or hostname. 




## About script

The script takes two command-line arguments: the IP address or hostname and the port number. The script uses the socket module to create a new socket object for TCP communication and check whether the specified port is open or not.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- "socket" module
## Usage

To use the script run by command line:

```python
  python check_port.py <IP or hostname> <port number>
```

Make sure to replace <IP or hostname> with the IP address or hostname you want to check, and <port number> with the port number you want to check.
